\part{Introduction}

\section{What are Bylaws}

Bylaws are rules promulgated by the Board.

\section{Official Versions of Documents}

The official versions of the Bylaws and Chater are those documents held in the organizational Github repository at https://github.com/ucrcyber. Modifications to this repository will be limited to officers.

\part{Organizational Membership}

\section{Rosters}

The Secretary shall maintain the roster of members. A copy shall be kept, free of personally identifiable information (such as full email addresses), on the organizational Github repository.

\section{Definition of "General Member"}

An "Active General Member" shall be any person who is a registered student at the University of California-Riverside and meets at least one of the following criteria, and has paid any dues required by the organization:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Attends at least four (4) General Meetings total in an academic year and notes their attendance on a Roster prepared by a member of the Board (usually the Secretary), beginning in the Winter 2017 quarter, and at least one (1) General Meeting in each quarter of the academic year (excluding summer quarter),
	\item Has participated in a club-sanctioned security competition,
	\item A board member may elect one student per academic year to the Active General Membership who would otherwise not meet the basic criteria.
\end{itemize}
These students will be given voting rights in General Elections, be allowed to run for office, and be granted all other rights of General Members as defined in our Charter. A student who meets General Membership criteria shall be considered such for that academic year.

An active UCR student who has previously met the critera for an Active General Member but does not in a subsequent year is considered an Inactive General Member and is not allowed to run for office or participate in general elections.

\section{Definition of "Alumni Member"}

Any student who met the criteria for Active General Membership at the time of their actual membership, but who then graduates and becomes and almunus of the University. Alumni are welcome at all meetings, but may not participate in General Elections nor run for office.

\section{Definition of "General Community Member"}

Any member of the organization who otherwise meets the critera for an Active General Member but who is not affiliated with the University of California-Riverside.
