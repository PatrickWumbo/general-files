The Logo depicts a "glider" construct from Conway's Game of Life. The rationale
for the use of this logo can be found here:
http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/

The logo appears intermittently in "hacker culture," most notably (to us) on the
cover of the Red Team Field Manual, but also in other places.

The text below, "cyber@ucr~$" is meant to emulate a standard terminal prompt
in Debian. Debian is chosen because it is the basis of the "Kali Linux" general
penetration testing suite.

The green color is meant to emulate the color of terminals that were displayed
in old CRT monitors. The slight blur is also intentional, and is also meant
to emulate the "glow" effect of old terminal windows.

(Other guidelines describing more specific things about size and such can be
added here later if future leadership desires, but I thought it'd be good to
drop in the reasons for the original logo.)
